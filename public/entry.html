        Imagine you are walking around your neighbourhood when you see a bunch of garbage pilling up the street. What do you do? Just seat at the curbside and cry? Go back to home and pretend the problem is not there? Or hope or pray to anyone else do something about it?
        <br><br>Citizen App is here to help you to connect with the authorities and city administrators to take actions to solve the problem. You can also connect with your neighbours to support each other and track the status of the reports.
